# Self-Evaluation

- This final CFU encompassed everything you've learned in Mod 0, and maybe even required some learning outside of what you've explicitly been taught. How did it feel as you faced these challenges?

I felt relatively confident. I have really enjoyed seeing how these concepts stack as we learn new things, and how as we move forward we continue to practice even the most rudimentary tasks. Repetition definitely helps to complete my understanding of a concept.

- How is your workflow going, in terms of taking breaks, staying focused, etc.?

For the most part my workflow is going well. I am taking breaks when needed, whether it be due to unproductive struggle, or just recognizing that I have been at the computer for an hour without a break. I have no issues with staying focused, I just need to work on not getting stressed when a concept *feels* like it is going over my head.

- What did you learn from this exercise that you want to remember as you begin Mod 1?

That I am capable of learning a variety of brand new concepts, and that I can piece them together to make something more complex than I would have thought possible at the beginning of mod0
